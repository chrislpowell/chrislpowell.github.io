# Standing in Reality

This repository hosts the public-facing materials for *Standing in Reality* —  
a framework focused on structure, autonomy, and ethical meaning-making.

The project includes:
- A primary manuscript
- A companion text intended for non-academic readers
- Supporting materials and future follow-up work

The live site is available at:  
https://standinginreality.org

This repository is intentionally minimal.  
Discussion and engagement are handled outside the codebase.
