  <h1>How to Read This</h1>

  <p>
    This text does not require agreement, completion, or sustained attention in order to be useful. It is not designed to persuade or resolve anything, and it can be set down at any point without loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are free to read at your own pace, skip sections, return later, or stop entirely. Nothing here depends on reaching the end or holding on to any particular idea.
  </p>

  <p>
    The framework described here focuses on process rather than content. It attends to how meaning, identity, and pressure tend to form in experience, rather than offering conclusions about what should be believed or adopted. Because of this, different readers may notice different things, or notice nothing in particular at all. All of these responses are ordinary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some ideas may feel immediately familiar. Others may feel irrelevant or uninteresting. Neither response indicates progress or difficulty. The text is not meant to be internalized, applied, or carried forward unless it settles that way naturally.
  </p>

  <p>
    If at any point reading begins to feel effortful, tense, or demanding, that is a good place to pause. The framework does not gain clarity through strain, and nothing essential depends on continued engagement.
  </p>

  <p>
    What this text offers resolves itself when it no longer asks anything of your attention. If attention naturally falls away, that is already enough.
